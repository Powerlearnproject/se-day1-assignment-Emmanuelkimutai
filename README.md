Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

1)Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with design, development, testing and maintenance od software applications.
2)Software engineering provides a way to manage the resource, schedule and budget of the project, and ensure the team is working correctly and on course.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1)Process of developing software- comming up with the idea and finaly making it a product.
2)process of maintaining software - this is kepping up with the emerging technology and be able to keep the product running
3)process of updating software - always improving the product to meet the markets needs

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1)Planning - Organizing and comming up with the team and processes of how to handle the project.
2)Requirement analysis - Collecting users needs and defining the how 
3)Design- comming up with the prototype and the flows of the product.
4)Coding - Writting down the actual code for the product
5)Testing - checking if the product meets users requests. 
6)Deploying - Giving the product access to the owner
7)Maintainance - Following up on the product and making sure it runs at its best.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies follows the projects outlined scope and goes step by step untill the final stage before it is released to the client, while Agile methodology has flexibility that gives the team chances to reponse quickly and adaptive during the development stages.
example; after the requirements have been analysed the waterfall methodology will not compromise the flow even if there are changes made, however for the Agile the is room for change in the steps depending on the urgency and also the nature of the expectations.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - They are responsible for the design and the development of the project.
Quality Assurance engineer - They are responsible for checking the requirements of by the users if it has been achieved, and the standard of the project is done okay.
Project Manager - There responsibility is to be the overseer of all teams, integrating them together to work and function seamlessly. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are very helpfull in that in gives the developers an environment to work on the project and even test them before deploying. eg VSCode
VCS are used to manage the live product version and also helps when doing updates or collaboration with other developers. eg GITHUB


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Technology advancement - new technology keep comming up and needs software engineers to be upto date on how to improve their products to be able to accomodate the technology.
Customer demands during development stages - This hinders the developers from completing the project on time and hence requiring the team to have a proper way of handling new requirements after the developments has started.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit Testing - is used by developers to identify if the module of the system is working correctly.
Integration Testing - This test is to determine if the components of the system work together and communicates together.
system testing - this is to determine the functionality of the system as a whole and how it meets the requirements.
Acceptance testing - This is used by developers to try and see if the client requirements are fulfilled, it is usually a finished product or close to finished.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing and optimizing prompts to guide AI models on response. This makes the response AI generates to be more accurate.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt - Hi, write a create an image with computers.
improved- Hi, generate an image of a computer with a code snippet on a desk.
