# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with design, development, testing and maintenance od software applications.
Software engineering provides a way to manage the resource, schedule and budget of the project, and ensure the team is working correctly and on course.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Process of developing software- comming up with the idea and finaly making it a product.
process of maintaining software - this is kepping up with the emerging technology and be able to keep the product running
process of updating software - always improving the product to meet the markets needs

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Organizing and comming up with the team and processes of how to handle the project.
Requirement analysis - Collecting users needs and defining the how 
Design- comming up with the prototype and the flows of the product.
Coding - Writting down the actual code for the product
Testing - checking if the product meets users requests. 
Deploying - Giving the product access to the owner
Maintainance - Following up on the product and making sure it runs at its best.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies follows the projects outlined scope and goes step by step untill the final stage before it is released to the client, while Agile methodology has flexibility that gives the team chances to reponse quickly and adaptive during the development stages.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - They are responsible for the design and the development of the project.
Quality Assurance engineer - They are responsible for checking the requirements of by the users if it has been achieved, and the standard of the project is done okay.
Project Manager - There responsibility is to be the overseer of all teams, integrating them together to work and function seamlessly. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
